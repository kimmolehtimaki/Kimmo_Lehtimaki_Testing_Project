> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

- Manual testing of the gitlab application was interesting. This task was exactly that kind of practical skills I'm looking for as an outcome of the courses. Also the application itself was also clear and easy to use and hence good learning platform for testing beginners

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.

-I tried to keep test cases simple and not too detailed at the beginning. But the more I got into the assignment the more precisely I wanted to perform.
-First I tried to write the test cases based on my assumptions of how application behaves, but once I started to conduct the actual tests, I was able to gain more knowledge about the application and modified my test cases accordingly.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management.

-This was good learning experience to begin with. I realized it helps once you keep the test cases in logical order.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

- Visual Studio Code

## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

- At the beginning it was a bit difficult to define Use cases and to write test steps concisely. After going through learning material in Canvas and also some additional learning material in Youtube tasks became more clear

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

- I had some problems to create the repositorys to Github since I haven't used it for a long time. This caused to me to submit the assignment on time. I have used Github previously in other cources, but as mentioned it's been a while.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

-No previous experience of any automated tools. Needs bit studying first, however Robot Framework sounds something I would be keen to look into.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

-Awareness of Databases(SQL) and data structures (JSON, XML)
-Understanding Agile
-Analytical skills and problem solving
-Knowledge of programming languages
-knowledge of automated test frameworks (e.g. Selenium, Robot Fframework,)
-GUI and API automation knowledge

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

-Knowledge and skills in different automation testing technologies and technical skills in programming

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas?

-Through the project assignment it was a great help to reflect theoratical modules into practise. At the beginnig I did not find the study to be too interesting but eventually when the understanding of the topic increased the more facinating the topic started to feel. And as mentioned earlier, especially the project task was eventually super interesting and provided lot of practical knowledge over the topic. Precipio as a learning platform felt too detailed and frustrating at the beginning, however towards the end it also provided some valuable insights over the topic.
